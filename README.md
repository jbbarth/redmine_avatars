Redmine Avatars plugin
======================

This plugin helps you manage local avatars for your Redmine users. It's equivalent to the "redmine_local_avatars" plugin (some informations [in this redmine.org forum thread](http://www.redmine.org/boards/3/topics/5365)). Unfortunately, this plugin is untested, not really maintained, not functional in development mode, and incompatible with Redmine 2.x.
